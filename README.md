# scala-js-snabbdom

This project started as a straightforward clone of [Snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom) (roughly equivalent to version 3.4.0).
Version 0.1.x stays close to the original, while 0.2.x departs from it in several ways, notably by making many things immutable.
We are happy to fix bugs in the 0.1.x line within reason.
