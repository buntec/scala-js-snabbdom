# scala-js-snabbdom

![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.buntec/scala-js-snabbdom_sjs1_2.13)

This project started as a Scala.js clone of [Snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom)
(roughly equivalent to version 3.4.0). Version 0.1.x stays close to the original,
while 0.2.x departs from it in several ways, notably by making many things immutable.
We are happy to fix bugs in the 0.1.x line within reason.

Artifacts are published to Maven Central for Scala 2.13 and Scala 3.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.github.buntec" %%% "scala-js-snabbdom" % "x.y.z"
```

See the test suites for usage examples.
